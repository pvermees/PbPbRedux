Description: The Pb-budget of meteorites consists of extraterrestrial and terrestrial components. The two components can be separated by spiking the sample with a solution that contains synthetic Pb-202 and Pb-205. The spike serves two purposes. First, the Pb-205 in it is used as a tracer to compare the sample (which is a mixture of extraterrestrial and terrestrial Pb) with a blank solution (which contains only terrestrial Pb). Second, if the true Pb-205/Pb-202 ratio of the spike is known, then this can be used to correct for mass-dependent fractionation. The package performs all these calculations in logratio space, so as to reduce the skewness of the mass spectrometer noise. It uses a maximum likelihood approach to ensure that blank corrections cannot result in negative values.
